Created a Class for implementing the methods as well running the tests for them.
Used Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file to get the results for all the methods then hardcoded them in the unit tests to get the results.
Didn't pay attention to the .pdf file in the Level up therefore forgot to look at all the things mentioned in the file like requirements and considerations.
Will make sure to be thorough in doing the coding task from next time.
For this time I am just providing the basic code that I've used.
